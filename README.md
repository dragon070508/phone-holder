Hello, this project is for a phone stand for standard size phones. I mainly made this for use on my desk and in airplanes and so far it's been awesome!

For some phones with cases you will need to scale it slightly up for it to fit. I tested it with my Samsung and Iphones everything worked with slim or no cases.

The keychain loop fits standard sized chain links as seen in the picture.

   - If you'd like scale it up within the 3D printing slicer, and use the measuring tool to get it to the right size. Depending on your printer tolerances the joint will be perfect or slightly loose.
